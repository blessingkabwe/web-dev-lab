I have learnt that Git keeps a record of all changes made to the code, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
it also allows developers to create separate branches for new features or bug fixes and then merge them int the main codebase  
Git iis als used to create a repository and also to commit changes
allows multiple developers to work on the same code base simultaneosly
